# Create a star rating app :star::star::star::star::star:

**The rating widget should give the user the option to give a rating from 1 to 5.**

As a guidline, how the finished product could be looking, please use the picture as a refernce. 

- split your app into components
- produce 5 icons
- to manage your state use the useState Hook from React
- when you hover over the icons, it should give you a preview of how the icons might look.
- the preview should only be temporary, once the user moves the mouse away from the widget, the original state should be rendered.
- The click event should call a handler function, which should change the state - and change the rendered output

## hint

- To display your stars you can use the `<FaStar/>` from React icons `npm i react-icons` already included in this project. (Have a look in your `package.json` file under dependencies.)
