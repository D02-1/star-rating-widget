## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise

:black_circle: Split your app up into components.
:black_circle: Produce 5 icons.
:black_circle: To manage your state use the `useState` Hook from React.
:black_circle: When you hover over the icons, it should give you a preview of how the icons might look.
:black_circle: The preview should only be temporary, once the user moves the mouse away from the widget, the original state should be rendered.
:black_circle: The click event should call a handler function, which should change the state - and change the rendered output.

## :eye_speech_bubble: hint

- To display your stars you could use the `<FaStar/>` from React icons. The npm package React icons has already been included in this project. (Have a look in your `package.json` file under dependencies.)

```javascript
//import the icon into your component
import { FaBeer } from 'react-icons/fa';
//use the icon like that in your component
<h3> Lets go for a <FaBeer />? </h3>
```
